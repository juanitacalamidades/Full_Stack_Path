        In this project, you will use what you know about iterating over arrays to improve 
        the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph. 
        This is the same type of work that word processing software does. Additionally, you may have heard of linting, 
        a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application. 
        In this project, you will create a miniature version of a linter using array methods that you have learned. 


        In the code editor, there is a string called story. 
        We want to gather some information about the individual words and sentences in the string. 
        Letâ€™s split the string into individual words and save them in a new array called storyWords.

        let story = 'Last weekend, I took literally the most beautiful bike ride of my life. The route is called "The 9W to Nyack" and it actually stretches all the way from Riverside Park in Manhattan to South Nyack, New Jersey. It\'s really an adventure from beginning to end! It is a 48 mile loop and it basically took me an entire day. I stopped at Riverbank State Park to take some extremely artsy photos. It was a short stop, though, because I had a really long way left to go. After a quick photo op at the very popular Little Red Lighthouse, I began my trek across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey.  The GW is actually very long - 4,760 feet! I was already very tired by the time I got to the other side.  An hour later, I reached Greenbrook Nature Sanctuary, an extremely beautiful park along the coast of the Hudson.  Something that was very surprising to me was that near the end of the route you actually cross back into New York! At this point, you are very close to the end.';

        console.log('Story words count: ' + storyWords.length);

        const betterWords = storyWords.filter(word => !unnecessaryWords.includes(word));

        //console.log(betterWords);

                veryCount += 1;

        Now, count how many sentences are in the paragraph.

        This may seem tricky, but remember that all of the sentences in this paragraph 
        end with a period (.) or an exclamation mark (!). You could iterate over the array 
        and add 1 to a sentence counter variable for each word that has a period or exclamation mark as its final character.
